# Neural_Net_Study

Here I'l upload my attempts to create working neural network.
This project is only for my personal studying purposes, but if you find this code usefull, you are wellcome to take and use it with no any ristrictions.

For the beginnig, I'l follow this papers:
1. https://habr.com/ru/post/312450/
2. https://habr.com/ru/post/313216/


For now, this net can simulate simple logical functions.

For detaled description, see my paper on LInkedIn

PS


Also, have to point out, that I use Visual studio SE 17.
If one sees this code years after upload, keep that in mind))

master branch - Basic neural net. All the functionality is develope, but the net structure is rather simple/

Perceptron branch - Simple perceptron taught to recognize 10 different characters of size 15

Working on teaching perceptron to recognize different chineese characters
